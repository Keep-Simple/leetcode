"""
The Fast & Slow pointer approach, also known as the Hare & Tortoise algorithm,
is a pointer algorithm that uses two pointers which move through the array (or sequence/LinkedList) at different speeds.
This approach is quite useful when dealing with cyclic LinkedLists or arrays.

By moving at different speeds (say, in a cyclic LinkedList), the algorithm proves that the two pointers are bound to meet.
The fast pointer should catch the slow pointer once both the pointers are in a cyclic loop.

One of the famous problems solved using this technique was Finding a cycle in a LinkedList.
Letâ€™s jump onto this problem to understand the Fast & Slow pattern.
