    Given an array containing 0s, 1s and 2s, sort the array in-place.
    You should treat numbers of the array as objects, hence,
    we canâ€™t count 0s, 1s, and 2s to recreate the array.

    The flag of the Netherlands consists of three colors: red, white and blue;
    and since our input array also consists of three different numbers
    that is why it is called Dutch National Flag problem.
