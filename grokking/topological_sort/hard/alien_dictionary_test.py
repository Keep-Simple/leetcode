    There is a dictionary containing words from an alien language
    sorted lexicographically
    for which we donâ€™t know the ordering of the letters.
    Write a method to find the correct order of the letters in the alien language.
    It is given that the input is a valid dictionary
    and there exists an ordering among its letters.

    Solution:
        - build a adjacency list for each node (using the fact that words are sorted lexicographically)
        - use bfs topological sort to find the ordering


    TC and SC:
        V = number of different characters
        E = total number of rules, each words pair give us one rule
