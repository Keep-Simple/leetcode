Topological Sort is used to find a linear ordering of elements 
that have dependencies on each other.
For example, if event ‘B’ is dependent on event ‘A’, ‘A’ comes before ‘B’
in topological ordering.
This pattern defines an easy way to understand the technique for 
performing topological sorting 
of a set of elements and then solves a few problems using it.



Topological Sort of a directed graph (a graph with unidirectional edges) 
is a linear ordering of its vertices such that for every directed edge (U, V)
from vertex U to vertex V, U comes before V in the ordering.
