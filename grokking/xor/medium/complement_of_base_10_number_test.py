    Every non-negative integer N has a binary representation, for example,
    8 can be represented as “1000” in binary and 7 as “0111” in binary.

    The complement of a binary representation is the number in binary
    that we get when we change every 1 to a 0 and every 0 to a 1.
    For example, the binary complement of “1010” is “0101”.
