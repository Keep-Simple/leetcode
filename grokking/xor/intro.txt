XOR is a logical bitwise operator that returns 0 (false) 
if both bits are the same and returns 1 (true) otherwise.
In other words, it only returns 1 if exactly one bit is set to 1 out of the two bits in comparison.

Following are some important properties of XOR to remember:

Taking XOR of a number with itself returns 0, e.g.,
1 ^ 1 = 0
29 ^ 29 = 0

Taking XOR of a number with 0 returns the same number, e.g.,
1 ^ 0 = 1
31 ^ 0 = 31

XOR is Associative & Commutative, which means:
(a ^ b) ^ c = a ^ (b ^ c)
a ^ b = b ^ a
